##server

I currently have a server for NewOS called [newos.nl](http://newos.nl/), but the server was free and it currently has to many downtimes for me to properly maintain it. 

Therefore I am hosting the files using GitHub Pages. The project can be found at [http://blade1989.github.io/NewOS/](http://blade1989.github.io/NewOS/). According to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), I can use [jekyll to blog](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages) with [custom URLs](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages). 

Need to do some documenation reading before I can have everything properly set up. But, I think in the long run it will be well worth it.
